# Task: Backend Developer (NestJS)

This section focuses on assessing the practical skills of a backend developer using Node.js and NestJS. The tasks evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to build and optimize APIs, handle databases, and implement key backend functionalities.

## Timebox and Submission Guidelines

- **Framework:** NestJS
- **Format:** Please submit your work as a Git repository (e.g., via GitHub, GitLab) or as a ZIP file containing the project files.
- **Instructions:** Ensure that your submission's README file includes all required setup instructions (e.g., how to run the project and install dependencies).

## Task 1: Basic API Development

**Objective:** Build a simple CRUD API for managing a list of users.

### Requirements:

- Create endpoints for **creating**, **reading**, **updating**, and **deleting** users.
- Implement **proper validation** for the input data.
- Ensure **error handling** is in place for invalid operations (e.g., trying to update a non-existent user).

---

## Task 2: Middleware Implementation

**Objective:** Implement a middleware to log the time taken for each API request.

### Requirements:

- The middleware should log the **start** and **end** times of each request.
- Ensure the log includes the **endpoint accessed** and the **HTTP method** used.

---

## Task 3: Error Handling

**Objective:** Create a global error-handling mechanism.

### Requirements:

- Implement a **global exception filter** to handle exceptions (e.g., `NotFoundException`, `BadRequestException`).
- Ensure that the **error responses** are consistent and informative.

---

## Task 4: Database Integration

**Objective:** Set up a PostgreSQL database connection and integrate it with the API.

### Requirements:

- Use **Prisma** or **TypeORM** to connect to the PostgreSQL database.
- Create a **service** that fetches data from a specific table and returns it as a REST endpoint response.

---

## Task 5 (Optional): Unit Testing

**Objective:** Write unit tests for one of the services implemented in the API.

### Requirements:

- Use **Jest** for writing the tests.
- Ensure the tests cover both **positive** and **negative** cases.

---

## Task 6 (Optional): JWT Authentication

**Objective:** Implement JWT-based authentication for the user CRUD API.

### Requirements:

- Secure the **CRUD endpoints** so that only authenticated users can access them.
- Ensure the **JWT tokens** are properly validated and handled.
